# Travelling Salesman Problem

## Hypothesis

Parallelized Brute Force with time complexity O(N!) might be more suitable for some problem sizes compared to the famous Held-Karp Algorithm.

## Correct Implementation

Credits to William Fiset for his [implementation of the Held Karp Algorithm](https://github.com/williamfiset/Algorithms/blob/master/src/main/java/com/williamfiset/algorithms/graphtheory/TspDynamicProgrammingIterative.java), written in Java.
