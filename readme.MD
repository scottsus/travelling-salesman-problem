# Travelling Salesman Problem

## Idea

We'll be benchmarking the Bellman-Held-Karp Algorithm against 3 graph algorithms learned in CS270, namely: Greedy Approach, Dijkstra's Algorithm, and Bellman Ford Algorithm, which we plan to parallelize.

## Correct Implementation

Credits to William Fiset for his [implementation of the solution](https://github.com/williamfiset/Algorithms/blob/master/src/main/java/com/williamfiset/algorithms/graphtheory/TspDynamicProgrammingIterative.java) to the TSP, written in Java.
